# ART Cognitive Architecture for Text Generation

This module implements Grossberg-based neural dynamics with unlimited sequence processing capabilities, serving as a transformer output replacement component.

## Project Overview

This system implements Grossberg's neural dynamics while addressing the fundamental 7¬±2 working memory limitation through hierarchical compression and multi-timescale processing.

## Key Achievements

### Cognitive Architecture Implementation
- Recursive Hierarchical Memory: 7¬±2 chunking with approximately 20,000 token effective capacity
- Multi-timescale Processing: Parallel working memories across temporal scales
- No Catastrophic Forgetting: ART resonance-based learning preserves existing patterns
- Real-time Incremental Learning: Continuous adaptation without retraining
- Biological Plausibility: Respects cognitive constraints while achieving practical scale

### Performance Results
- Training Speed: 28 seconds for 42MB corpus (8.27M tokens)
- Pattern Learning: 13.9M n-gram patterns, 231K syntactic patterns
- Memory Capacity: 113,405 unique tokens, 111K semantic clusters
- Retention: Maintains all learned patterns during continuous learning

## Architecture Overview

This system implements the cognitive architecture described in [`solving sequence length limitations`](original-requirements/solving-sequence-length-limitations.md), providing six key innovations:

### 1. Recursive Hierarchical Memory
```java
// Achieves approximately 20,000 token capacity with 7¬±2 constraint
RecursiveHierarchicalMemory(levels=5)
- Level 0: 7 tokens
- Level 1: 49 compressed tokens  
- Level 2: 343 compressed phrases
- Level 3: 2,401 compressed paragraphs
- Level 4: 16,807 compressed sections
```

### 2. Multi-timescale Memory Bank
```java
MultiTimescaleMemoryBank {
  phoneme: WorkingMemory(capacity=7, tau=0.1s)     // 100ms timescale
  word:    WorkingMemory(capacity=7, tau=1.0s)     // 1s timescale
  phrase:  WorkingMemory(capacity=7, tau=10.0s)    // 10s timescale
  sentence:WorkingMemory(capacity=7, tau=60.0s)    // 1min timescale
  paragraph:WorkingMemory(capacity=7, tau=600.0s)  // 10min timescale
}
```

### 3. Advanced Pattern Generation
```java
EnhancedPatternGenerator {
  - Top-k, Top-p, Temperature sampling
  - Repetition penalty with n-gram tracking
  - Multiple generation modes (conservative, creative, balanced, precise)
  - Context-aware semantic scoring
  - Beam search capability
}
```

## üöÄ **Transformer Replacement Advantages**

This system provides significant advantages over standard transformers:

| Feature | Standard Transformers | ART Cognitive Architecture |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Memory Growth** | Quadratic O(n¬≤) | Logarithmic O(log n) |
| **Catastrophic Forgetting** | Yes - requires full retraining | No - ART resonance preserves patterns |
| **Incremental Learning** | Expensive retraining | Real-time adaptation |
| **Explainability** | Black-box attention | Clear pattern activation traces |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Billions of parameters | Hierarchical compression |
| **Training Speed** | Hours/days | Seconds |
| **Biological Plausibility** | No | Yes - respects 7¬±2 constraint |
