# Deprecated Documentation

This directory contains documentation that was created based on incorrect assumptions about the project requirements.

## Background

Early documentation incorrectly framed this project as a failed chatbot implementation when the actual goal was to create a cognitive architecture for unlimited sequence processing - a transformer output replacement component.

## Deprecated Files

These files contain gap analyses and assessments based on the incorrect assumption that the project should have been a multi-turn conversational chatbot:

- `GAP_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive gap analysis with incorrect chatbot framing
- `GAP_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary of incorrect gap assessment  
- `GAP_ANALYSIS_INDEX.md` - Index of gap analysis documents
- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_GAP.md` - Simple explanation of misunderstood requirements

## Correct Understanding

The project successfully implemented:
- Recursive hierarchical memory with 7Â±2 chunking achieving approximately 20,000 token capacity
- Multi-timescale processing with parallel working memories
- ART resonance-based learning without catastrophic forgetting
- Advanced pattern generation suitable for transformer output replacement
- Unlimited sequence processing while respecting biological constraints

## Current Documentation

See the main [`docs/`](../README.md) directory for accurate documentation that correctly frames this as a successful cognitive architecture implementation.
