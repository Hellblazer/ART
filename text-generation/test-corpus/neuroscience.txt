The human brain is a complex organ composed of billions of neurons. These neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signals. Neural networks in the brain process information in parallel. Synaptic plasticity allows the brain to learn and adapt. Memory formation involves changes in synaptic strength. The cortex is organized into specialized regions for different functions. Visual processing occurs in the occipital lobe. Language processing involves Broca's and Wernicke's areas. The hippocampus is crucial for memory consolidation. Neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin regulate mood and behavior.
