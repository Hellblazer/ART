Artificial intelligence aims to create intelligent machines. Machine learning enables computers to learn from data. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers. Natural language processing helps computers understand human language. Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information. Reinforcement learning teaches agents through rewards and penalties. Supervised learning requires labeled training data. Unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabeled data. Transfer learning leverages knowledge from one task to another. Neural networks are inspired by biological brain structures.
