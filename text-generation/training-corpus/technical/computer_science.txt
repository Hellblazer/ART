Computer Science Principles and Algorithms

Computer science encompasses the study of computation, information processing, and
the design of computer systems. Algorithms form the foundation, providing
step-by-step procedures for solving computational problems efficiently.

Data structures organize and store data for efficient access and modification.
Arrays provide constant-time access, linked lists excel at insertion and deletion,
trees enable hierarchical organization, and graphs represent complex relationships.

Complexity analysis measures algorithm efficiency using Big O notation. Linear
algorithms scale proportionally with input size, while logarithmic algorithms
provide excellent performance for large datasets. Understanding time and space
complexity guides optimal algorithm selection.

Programming paradigms shape how we structure code. Object-oriented programming
encapsulates data and behavior, functional programming emphasizes immutability
and pure functions, and procedural programming follows sequential execution.

Distributed systems coordinate multiple computers to work as a unified system.
Challenges include maintaining consistency, handling failures, and ensuring
scalability. Consensus algorithms, replication strategies, and load balancing
techniques address these challenges.
