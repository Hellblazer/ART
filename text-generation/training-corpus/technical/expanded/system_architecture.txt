=== System Architecture Documentation ===

## Overview

The system follows a microservices architecture pattern with the following key components:

### Frontend Layer
The presentation layer consists of a responsive web application built with modern frameworks. It communicates with backend services through a RESTful API gateway. Client-side caching and lazy loading optimize performance. Progressive Web App capabilities enable offline functionality.

### API Gateway
The gateway serves as a single entry point for all client requests. It handles authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. Load balancing distributes traffic across service instances. Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures.

### Service Layer
Core business logic resides in loosely coupled microservices. Each service owns its data and exposes well-defined interfaces. Services communicate through message queues for asynchronous operations. Synchronous calls use HTTP/REST with appropriate timeouts.

### Data Layer
Polyglot persistence allows each service to choose appropriate storage. Relational databases handle transactional data. NoSQL stores manage unstructured content. Caching layers reduce database load.

### Infrastructure
Container orchestration manages service deployment and scaling. Monitoring and logging provide operational visibility. Automated CI/CD pipelines ensure rapid, reliable deployments. Infrastructure as Code maintains consistency across environments.
