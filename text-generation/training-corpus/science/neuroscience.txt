Neuroscience and Brain Function

The human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons interconnected through
trillions of synapses. This complex network gives rise to perception, cognition,
emotion, and consciousness through electrochemical signaling.

Neurons communicate via action potentials - rapid changes in electrical charge
that propagate along axons. When action potentials reach synaptic terminals,
they trigger neurotransmitter release. These chemical messengers cross the
synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on receiving neurons.

Brain regions specialize for different functions. The frontal lobe handles
executive function and motor control. The temporal lobe processes auditory
information and memory. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information.
The occipital lobe manages visual processing.

Neuroplasticity allows the brain to reorganize throughout life. Synaptic
plasticity strengthens or weakens connections based on use. Structural
plasticity involves physical changes like dendritic branching and synapse
formation. This adaptability underlies learning and recovery from injury.

Memory formation involves encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. The
hippocampus plays a crucial role in forming new memories and spatial navigation.
Long-term potentiation strengthens synaptic connections, providing a cellular
mechanism for learning.
