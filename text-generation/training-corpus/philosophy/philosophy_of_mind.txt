Philosophy of Mind and Consciousness

The philosophy of mind explores the nature of mental phenomena and their
relationship to the physical world. Central questions include the mind-body
problem, the nature of consciousness, and the possibility of artificial minds.

Dualism posits that mind and body are distinct substances. Descartes argued
for substance dualism, claiming mental and physical realms interact through
the pineal gland. Property dualism suggests one substance with both mental
and physical properties.

Physicalism maintains that everything is physical or supervenes on the physical.
Eliminative materialists argue mental states don't exist, while reductive
physicalists believe mental states reduce to brain states. Non-reductive
physicalists accept mental properties as real but irreducible.

The hard problem of consciousness asks why subjective experience exists.
Phenomenal consciousness involves qualia - the subjective qualities of experience.
Access consciousness refers to information available for use in reasoning and
behavior.

Functionalism defines mental states by their causal relations. According to
this view, what makes something a mental state is its functional role, not
its physical substrate. This opens the possibility of artificial consciousness.
