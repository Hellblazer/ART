/**
 * High-performance vectorized FuzzyART implementation using Java Vector API.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - SIMD-optimized fuzzy operations (min, max, element-wise arithmetic)
 * - Vectorized complement coding operations
 * - Parallel processing for large category sets
 * - Cache-optimized data structures
 * - Performance monitoring and metrics
 * 
 * This implementation maintains full compatibility with FuzzyART semantics
 * while providing significant performance improvements through vectorization.
 * 
 * REFACTORED: Now uses AbstractVectorizedFuzzyART base class to eliminate
 * ~350 lines of boilerplate code while maintaining identical functionality.
