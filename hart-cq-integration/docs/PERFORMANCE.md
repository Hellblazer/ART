# HART-CQ Performance

## Current Status

HART-CQ is in active development. Performance characteristics have not been fully measured or validated.

## Design Goals

The system is designed with the following goals:
- Deterministic, template-based output
- Parallel processing through multiple channels
- Efficient memory usage
- Thread-safe concurrent operation

## Architecture for Performance

### Parallel Channel Processing
- 6 channels process features concurrently
- Each channel extracts different linguistic features
- Results are combined for hierarchical processing

### Memory Management
- Sliding window approach for bounded memory usage
- Template library loaded once and reused
- Efficient token representation

## Testing

Performance testing is planned but not yet complete. The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for the full pipeline
- Placeholder for performance benchmarks

## Future Work

- Implement comprehensive benchmarking suite
- Profile actual performance characteristics
- Optimize based on real measurements
- Consider GPU acceleration for channel processing
